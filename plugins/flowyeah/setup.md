# flowyeah.yml Interactive Setup

Shared setup instructions used by both `flowyeah:build` and `flowyeah:review` when `flowyeah.yml` is missing.

## When to Run

If `flowyeah.yml` does not exist in the project root, run this interactive setup before proceeding.

## Schema Reference

Valid keys, types, defaults, and allowed values are defined in `config-schema.md` at the plugin root. This setup asks questions to populate those keys.

## Questions

Ask each question in order. Use sensible defaults based on the project context.

### 1. Git host

> Where do you create PRs/MRs?

Detect from `git remote get-url origin`:
- Contains `github.com` → suggest `github`
- Contains `gitlab` → suggest `gitlab`
- Otherwise → ask

### 2. Adapters

> Which integrations do you use for issues/errors?

Options (multi-select):
- **gitlab** — GitLab issues
- **github** — GitHub issues
- **linear** — Linear issues (requires MCP plugin)
- **bugsink** — Bugsink errors (requires API token)
- **newrelic** — New Relic errors (requires API key)
- **ghactions** — GitHub Actions CI logs (requires `gh` CLI)

Default: include the git host. When `github` is selected as git host or as an adapter, suggest also enabling `ghactions`.

Any adapter with a `source.md` file is automatically available as a source — no separate list needed.

### 3. Adapter config

For each selected adapter, ask for required config:

| Adapter | Questions |
|---------|-----------|
| `gitlab` | URL, token env var name, token source file, project ID |
| `github` | (none — uses `gh` CLI) |
| `linear` | (none — uses MCP) |
| `bugsink` | URL, token env var name, token source file |
| `newrelic` | Token env var name, token source file, account ID |
| `ghactions` | (none — uses `gh` CLI, same as GitHub) |

### 4. Default branch

> What is your default branch?

Detect: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'`

Fallback: `main`

### 5. Test command

> What command runs your tests?

Detect from project files:
- `Gemfile` → suggest `bundle exec rspec`
- `package.json` with `test` script → suggest `npm test` or `yarn test`
- `Cargo.toml` → suggest `cargo test`
- Otherwise → ask

### 6. Test scope

> Run full suite or only related tests?

Options: `related` (default), `full`

### 6b. Brainstorming

> Always brainstorm before implementing, or let AI decide?

Options: `always`, `auto` (default)

- **`always`** — every task goes through brainstorm → plan → TDD. Recommended for legacy, large, or critical codebases where even small changes need discussion.
- **`auto`** — AI assesses complexity: trivial tasks skip brainstorming, non-trivial tasks get the full cycle. Recommended for greenfield projects.

### 6c. Implementation approval

> Approve implementation before pushing, or let AI decide?

Options: `always`, `auto` (default)

- **`always`** — present the implementation for developer approval before pushing. Recommended for legacy, large, or critical codebases where every change needs human review before leaving the local environment.
- **`auto`** — AI assesses risk: straightforward changes push automatically, complex or high-risk changes ask. Recommended for greenfield projects.

### 6d. Worktree isolation

Multiple worktrees can run concurrently, so each needs isolated system dependencies (database, Redis, etc.). Always ask these questions.

> Which files should be symlinked from the main checkout into worktrees?

These are untracked files (config, dependencies) that worktrees need but shouldn't duplicate. Symlinks are created before env vars and setup commands, so setup commands can use them.

Suggest based on project files:
- `.env` present → suggest `.env`
- `node_modules/` present → suggest `node_modules`
- `vendor/bundle/` present → suggest `vendor/bundle`
- Otherwise → ask if there are untracked files or directories needed for running/testing

If none needed, leave empty.

> Which environment variables should be unique per worktree?

Suggest based on project files:
- `Gemfile` present → suggest `TEST_ENV_NUMBER` (Rails convention — `database.yml` appends this to the database name for parallel test databases)
- Any project → ask if they use Redis, Elasticsearch, or other stateful services that need isolation, and suggest corresponding env vars

Each env var can have value `auto` (generates a random 8-char URL-safe base64 string per worktree) or a fixed literal value.

> What commands should run after creating a worktree?

These run with the env vars exported. Suggest based on project files:
- `Gemfile` present → suggest `bundle exec rails db:test:prepare`
- `package.json` present → suggest `npm install` (if `node_modules` isn't shared)
- Otherwise → ask

> What commands should run before removing a worktree?

These run with the env vars exported. Suggest based on project files:
- `Gemfile` present → suggest `bundle exec rails db:drop DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK=1`
- Otherwise → ask

### 7. Language and commit conventions

> What language for commits, PRs, and review comments?

Default: `en`

> Commit convention?

Options: `conventional` (default), `freeform`

> Use a commit writer agent?

Options: `git-commit-writer` (default), `null` (write manually)

If `git-commit-writer`, the pipeline delegates commit message authoring to that agent. If `null`, commits are written inline.

### 8. PR/MR preferences

> Delete source branch after merge?

Default: `true`

> Rebase before push?

Default: `true`

> Merge behavior?

Options: `manual` (default), `auto`, `ask`

> Merge strategy?

Options: `squash` (default), `merge`, `rebase`

**Note:** If the git host is GitLab, warn that `rebase` is a project-level setting in GitLab and cannot be requested per merge request via API. Recommend `squash` or `merge` for GitLab projects.

### 9. Code review agents

> Which agents run code review?

Default:
```yaml
agents:
  - pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer
  - pr-review-toolkit:silent-failure-hunter
optional_agents:
  - pr-review-toolkit:comment-analyzer
  - pr-review-toolkit:type-design-analyzer
```

Ask if they want to customize the list.

### 9b. Review instructions

> Do you have a markdown file with project-specific review guidelines?

These are project-specific rules that review agents and critical checks should enforce (e.g., "all API changes require backward compatibility", "controllers must not contain business logic").

Options: **No** (default), **Yes**

If **Yes**: ask for the file path (suggest `.flowyeah/review-guidelines.md`), validate the file exists, add `code_review.instructions: <path>` to the generated YAML.

If **No**: skip, don't add the key.

### 10. Issues

> Create issues automatically when the source wasn't an issue tracker?

Options: `ask` (default), `always`, `never`

**If the user chose `always` or `ask`:**

> Which adapter handles issue creation?

Options: list the adapters selected in step 2 that support issue creation (gitlab, github, linear). Bugsink and New Relic are read-only sources — they cannot create issues.

**If the user chose `never`:** skip the adapter question.

### 11. Hooks

> Do you want to configure project-specific hooks for pipeline events?

Hooks are markdown files with instructions that the AI follows at specific pipeline points. They let you plug in project-specific behavior (e.g., milestone association after merge).

**Available hook points:**
- `after_merge` — runs after a successful merge, before marking the task done

If the user wants hooks, ask for the file path for each hook point (default: `.flowyeah/hooks/<hook-name>.md`). Remind the user they need to create the file with the instructions.

If the user doesn't want hooks, skip this section entirely (no `hooks` key in YAML).
